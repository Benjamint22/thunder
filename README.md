## Features

Thunder is currently undergoing **active development**, and it is possible that not all features have been fully implemented at this stage. This repository is also currently main

Due to this, significant breaking changes may occur between versions. The next section summarizes the features that are currently implemented.

#### **Communities**

- Browse communities

#### **Posts**

#### **Authentication**

#### **Theme & Customization**

## Roadmap

The current focus is to enable users to browse communities, see posts and comments, and be able to authenticate with their accounts.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! To contribute potential features or bug-fixes:

1. Fork this repository
2. Apply any changes and/or additions
3. Create a pull request to have your changes reviewed and merged

## Building From Source

There are a few prerequisites in order to build and run the application locally.

### Create an Environment File

Thunder uses `.env` to store secrets, including credentials for API access. This is an example of a minimal `.env` file.

```dart
// [REQUIRED] Lemmy specific information
LEMMU_BASE_URL = ""
```

### Installing Flutter and Related Dependencies

Thunder is developed with Flutter, and is built to support both iOS and Android.

To build the app from source, a few steps are required.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory as described in the previous section.
2. Set up and install Flutter.
   - For more information, visit https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install.
3. Clone this repository and fetch the dependencies using `flutter pub get`
4. Run the appropriate build command depending on the platform.
   - iOS: `flutter build ios --release`
   - Android: `flutter build apk`

## Conventions

While there are no specific conventions that must be followed, do try to follow best practices whenever possible.

Suggestions are always welcome to improve the code quality and architecture of the app!

## Related Packages

Thunder uses the following packages and libraries under the hood. This is not an exhaustive list.
